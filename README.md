# ...and more
- bloom level control
- cover art brightness level control
- ability to enable default cover art which shows when a song doesnt provide one 
- song previews on the song list can be set to toggleable, so that you dont have to hover over it to hear it; you just need to shoot it
- a very... amusing(?) easter egg
